Hello, my name is Quazi Irfan. I have graduated from South Dakota State University with a Master's in Statistics in Fall 2021. I've completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the same university in Summer 2018.

Currenlty I am looking for job as a Data Scientist(or related position). 

Here is my [résumé](https://github.com/quazi-irfan/quazi-irfan/blob/main/resume.pdf).
